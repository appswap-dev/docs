AppSwap CLI is a comprehensive command-line tool designed to solve the complexities of modern software publishing workflows. Whether you're maintaining a single package or managing a complex monorepo with multiple publishing targets, AppSwap CLI provides the automation and flexibility you need.

## The Problem

Modern software development involves complex publishing workflows:

- **Multiple Environments**: Different branches need different publishing strategies
- **Multiple Registries**: Publishing to NPM, private registries, GitHub Releases, etc.
- **Version Management**: Coordinating versions across platforms and branches
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automating releases without compromising on control
- **Branch Strategies**: Different rules for main, develop, feature, and hotfix branches

## The Solution

AppSwap CLI addresses these challenges with:

### 🎯 **Unified Configuration**
Single YAML configuration files that define your entire publishing strategy, from version calculation to destination mapping.

### 🌿 **Branch-Aware Publishing**
Different strategies for different branches:
- `main` → Production releases with GitHub Releases
- `develop` → Development releases with `dev` tag
- `feature/*` → Feature previews with branch-specific tags
- `hotfix/*` → Emergency patches with `hotfix` tag

### 📦 **Multi-Platform Support**
Built-in support for:
- **NPM Registries** (public, private, enterprise)
- **GitHub Releases** (with assets and release notes)
- **GitLab Releases** (coming soon)
- **Custom Destinations** (extensible architecture)

### 🔄 **Intelligent Versioning**
Multiple versioning strategies:
- **Semantic**: major.minor.patch increments
- **Prerelease**: alpha, beta, rc versions
- **Branch-based**: Include branch name in version
- **Calendar**: Date-based versioning (YYYY.MM.DD)

### 🎣 **Lifecycle Hooks**
Execute custom scripts at key points:
- Pre/post version hooks
- Pre/post publish hooks
- Custom build commands per branch

## Core Concepts

### Destinations
Publishing targets like NPM registries or GitHub Releases. Each destination has its own configuration for authentication, settings, and behavior.

### Branch Configurations
Rules that define which destinations to use, what versioning strategy to apply, and what build commands to run for specific branches or branch patterns.

### Version Strategies
Algorithms for calculating the next version number based on current state, published versions, and branch context.

### Hooks
Custom scripts that run at specific points in the publishing lifecycle, allowing for custom validation, building, or notification logic.

## Use Cases

### 📚 **Library Maintainers**
- Automatic semantic versioning
- GitHub Releases with changelog
- Multiple dist-tags for different stability levels

### 🏢 **Enterprise Teams**
- Private registry publishing
- Branch-specific environments
- Compliance and approval workflows

### 🚀 **Open Source Projects**
- Automated releases from CI/CD
- Community-friendly release notes
- Multiple package distribution channels

### 🔄 **Monorepo Management**
- Coordinated multi-package releases
- Shared configuration across packages
- Dependency-aware publishing

## Philosophy

AppSwap CLI is built on several key principles:

1. **Configuration over Convention**: While we provide sensible defaults, everything should be configurable
2. **Composability**: Small, focused commands that work well together
3. **Transparency**: Always show what would happen before doing it (dry-run mode)
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin-like architecture for custom destinations and hooks
5. **CI/CD First**: Designed from the ground up for automated environments
