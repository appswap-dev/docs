This guide will get you up and running with AppSwap CLI in just a few minutes. We'll set up a basic publishing workflow that works with NPM and GitHub Releases.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- [Node.js 18+](../installation/#requirements)
- [AppSwap CLI installed](../installation/)
- A Git repository with a `package.json` file
- NPM and GitHub tokens (for publishing)

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

1. **Initialize AppSwap CLI in your project**

   Navigate to your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   appswap init
   ```

   This creates the `.appswap/` directory with default configuration files.

2. **Review the generated configuration**

   AppSwap CLI creates several configuration files:

   ```
   .appswap/
   ├── publish.yaml    # Publishing destinations and branch rules
   ├── version.yaml    # Version calculation settings
   └── hooks/          # Custom scripts (optional)
   ```

3. **Configure your publishing destinations**

   Edit `.appswap/publish.yaml` to match your needs:

   ```yaml
   branches:
     main:
       destinations:
         - npm
         - github
       versionStrategy: minor
       distTag: latest
     develop:
       destinations:
         - npm
       versionStrategy: minor
       distTag: dev

   destinations:
     npm:
       type: npm
       registry: https://registry.npmjs.org
     github:
       type: github
       releaseNotes: true
       config:
         uploadAssets: true
   ```

4. **Set up authentication**

   Create environment variables for your tokens:

   ```bash
   # For NPM publishing
   export NPM_TOKEN="your-npm-token"

   # For GitHub Releases
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
   ```

   Or add them to your CI/CD environment.

5. **Test with dry run**

   Before making any real changes, test your configuration:

   ```bash
   # Check what version would be calculated
   appswap version --dry-run

   # Check what would be published
   appswap publish --dry-run
   ```

6. **Create your first version**

   When you're ready, create a new version:

   ```bash
   appswap version --message "Release v1.0.0"
   ```

   This will:
   - Calculate the next version number
   - Update `package.json`
   - Create a git commit and tag

7. **Publish your package**

   Publish to your configured destinations:

   ```bash
   appswap publish
   ```

   This will:
   - Publish to NPM with the correct dist-tag
   - Create a GitHub Release with assets
   - Run any configured hooks

</Steps>

## Example Workflow

Here's what a typical workflow looks like:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 2. Create a new version
appswap version --message "Release new feature"

# 3. Publish everywhere
appswap publish

# 4. Push to remote (if not automated)
git push origin main --tags
```

## Branch-Specific Behavior

AppSwap CLI automatically behaves differently based on your current branch:

### Main Branch
```bash
git checkout main
appswap publish
# → Publishes to NPM as 'latest'
# → Creates GitHub Release
```

### Develop Branch
```bash
git checkout develop
appswap publish
# → Publishes to NPM as 'dev'
# → No GitHub Release
```

### Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout feature/awesome-feature
appswap publish
# → Publishes to NPM as 'feature'
# → Version includes branch name
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

      - name: Install AppSwap CLI
        run: npm install -g @appswap/cli

      - name: Version and Publish
        run: |
          appswap version --message "Automated release"
          appswap publish --skip-git-checks
        env:
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Common Patterns

### Preview Releases

Create preview releases from feature branches:

```bash
git checkout feature/new-ui
appswap publish --target npm
# Publishes as: your-package@1.2.3-feature-new-ui.1
```

### Hotfix Releases

Quick patches with automatic versioning:

```bash
git checkout hotfix/security-fix
appswap version --strategy patch
appswap publish
# Creates: 1.2.4 with 'hotfix' dist-tag
```

### Multi-Registry Publishing

Publish to multiple registries:

```yaml
destinations:
  npm-public:
    type: npm
    registry: https://registry.npmjs.org
  npm-private:
    type: npm
    registry: https://npm.internal.company.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Version Not Calculated Correctly

Check your published versions:
```bash
appswap status
```

Specify a strategy manually:
```bash
appswap version --strategy patch
```

### Authentication Issues

Verify your tokens:
```bash
npm whoami --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
```

Test GitHub access:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### Configuration Issues

Validate your configuration:
```bash
appswap doctor
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic setup working:

1. **Explore Configuration**: Learn about [advanced configuration options](/configuration/overview/)
2. **Set Up Hooks**: Add [custom scripts](/configuration/hooks/) for builds and notifications
3. **Branch Strategies**: Configure [different strategies](/configuration/branches/) for different branches
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up [automated publishing](/cicd/github-actions/) in your pipeline
